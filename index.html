<br>
That was you upon the mountain <br>
All alone and all surrounded <br>
Walking on the ground you're breaking <br>
Laughing at the life you're wasting <br>
One, two, a jive won't do it <br>
You do it on your left <br>
And you'll never get through it <br>
Everything you'll have to see <br>
Dinner isn't just one day <br>
Good try, we don't like it <br>
Good try, we won't take that shit <br>
Oh, I can't win <br>
Things in bars that people do <br>
And no one wants to talk to you <br>
Feeling can be quite a breeze <br>
You told me that these girls were easy <br>
Happy that you said you know me <br>
Felt unlucky when you found me <br>
Some of us come up empty handed <br>
Yes, I'll take it <br>
Wait now, by the sidewalk <br>
Hold on, yes I'll be right back <br>
Oh, I can't win <br>
Yeah, I wait for something <br>
Cool it, we won't take that shit <br>
Good try, we don't like it <br>
Oh, yes I'll be right back <br>
