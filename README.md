That was you upon the mountain
All alone and all surrounded
Walking on the ground you're breaking
Laughing at the life you're wasting
One, two, a jive won't do it
You do it on your left
And you'll never get through it
Everything you'll have to see
Dinner isn't just one day
Good try, we don't like it
Good try, we won't take that shit
Oh, I can't win
Things in bars that people do
And no one wants to talk to you
Feeling can be quite a breeze
You told me that these girls were easy
Happy that you said you know me
Felt unlucky when you found me
Some of us come up empty handed
Yes, I'll take it
Wait now, by the sidewalk
Hold on, yes I'll be right back
Oh, I can't win
Yeah, I wait for something
Cool it, we won't take that shit
Good try, we don't like it
Oh, yes I'll be right back
